# context

The root of the solution is "C:\Src\talks\25\content-sdk\sug-content-sdk-nextjs"
The ComponentName is "Hero"

# steps

1. run the cli command `sitecore-tools project component scaffold src/components/SUGLON/[ComponentName]/[ComponentName] --templateName=fixDefault` from the root of the solution
2. locate the tsx file src/components/SUGLON/[ComponentName]/[ComponentName].tsx from the root of the solution and create an adjacent types file called [ComponentName].types.ts and import Field from @sitecore-content-sdk/nextjs and ComponentWithContextProps from lib/component-props.
3. move interfaces or types from the tsx file into the types file and then remove them from the tsx file

# guardrails

After running the cli command, do not try to automatically fix linting errors in the tsx file
After creating the types file, do not try to automatically fix linting errors in the types file
If the cli command fails, do not attempt to solve the problem another way
